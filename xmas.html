<p>let me tell you why xmas is awesome. xmas is about spending time with friends and family. it is about eating loads of delicious food, drinking plenty of booze (if youre into that sort of thing) and relaxing. its about spending all your money on other people instead of yourself, its about getting sentimental and reflecting on the past year. if you think xmas is a celebration of consumerism, i got news for you - our whole society is consumerist, of course theyre trying to shit on such a massive celebration. if you dont want to buy gifts then how about spending some time on creating gifts instead? its not about a specific religion anymore. some people say its a pagan thing, some people use it to celebrate a wise man from a few millennia ago, but it doesnt matter, because whatever your reason is, it brings us together. So let me be the first to say merry xmas, fuckers, i hope you have an excellent one.</p>
