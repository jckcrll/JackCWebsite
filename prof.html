<h1>dr jack carlyle</h1>
<p class="end">astrophysicist / solar physicist.</p>
<hr />
<p>i am currently employed at the university of oslo under the <a href="http://www.fchroma.org/">f-chroma</a> project, working on the analysis and interpretation of high spatial and temporal resolution solar flare observations and the development of archives of observations and models, with an emphasis on radiative magnetohydrodynamic modelling.</p>
<p>i recently completed a phd on observations and simulations of dense, erupted filament plasma as it moves through the solar atmosphere, undertaken at both university college london's department of space and climate physics, mullard space science laboratory (uk), and the max planck institute for solar system research (germany). i also spent some time learning magnetohydrodynamic simulation techniques at the university of kyoto (japan). i was elected as the student representative on the uk solar physics council in august 2013, and will continue to fulfil this duty until the next elections in august 2016, despite being neither a student nor uk based.</p>
