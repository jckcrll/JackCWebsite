<p>selfie tips</p>
<hr />
<p>i like selfies.
<br>i think everyone should love themselves for who they are
<br>and i have a hard time with that sometimes, and taking a fire selfie helps
<br>so i started encouraging people to take more with 'jacks guide to selfies 101'.

<br><br>"Hi everyone it's your girl Jack here with super simple tips for vastly improving yourselfies!!
Today's lesson is really straightforward: don't look at yourself on the screen, make eye contact with the camera! It's the little circle just above your screen probably. Right as you press the shutter just flick your eyes up slightly and the resulting picture will look ten thousand times more ðŸ”¥
Now go get snapping, I wanna see some SELFIES posted in the comments below AND on your own tl AND on everyone else's tls AND EVERYWHERE FOREVER"

<br><br>"It's ya gurl Jack back with another hot #selfie tip!! Today: composition! Whilst the vanilla "mug shot" is very effective a lot of the time, it can get boring. Find an interesting background, strike a pose that fits it all in, arrange the scene to be as pleasing to the eye as possible. This is an advanced technique but I believe in u!! And as my example goes to show, it doesn't need to be elaborate. Just find something pretty to stand in front of :)"
