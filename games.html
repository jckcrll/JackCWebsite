<p class="list"><a href="https://jckcrll.itch.io/space-weather">space-weather</a> is an edu-tainment game in which the player can control solar activity.
<br>by winding up and releasing magnetic fields and plasma at the right moment, aurora is triggered on earth.
<br>browser based game</p>
<p class="list"><a href="https://jckcrll.itch.io/spacewreck">space wreck</a> is a zero-gravity platformer made for the uk nerd punx 2017 summer game-jam.
<br>the aim is to explore a giant maze-like space ship and try to find the most valuable item of salvage to escape with.
<br>i hope to develop this further at some point to improve the level-design and graphics.
<br>windows only</p>
<p class="list">i have also made a very silly nsfw game but you need some context first. please do not read on if you don't want to see simulated male genitalia.
<br>first of all you'll need to <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/conan-exiles-dick-slider/">read about a game called conan exiles</a>.
<br>i find the idea of an 'endowment-slider' in a big-budget videogame both ridiculous and hilarious, and i wanted to make a game dedicated to swinging around a penis.
<br>so for the uk nerd punx january 2017 jam i made <a href="https://jckcrll.itch.io/dick-dangler">dick dangler</a>. the password is dangle. play at your own risk.
<br>browser based game</p>
